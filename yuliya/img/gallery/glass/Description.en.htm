    Every single space of our home could wear custom mosaic or stained glass elements: decor, cabinets, windows and doors, screens and wall-dividers, backsplashes, walls and floors, etc. Let your imagination run wild!!

    I create custom stained glass and mosaics pieces according to customer requirements. The unique sketch is prepared for every new project. Just as in classical painting, every project must respect some rules of art: composition, geometry, harmony, lines and points of strength, interaction of colours ... My studies in fine art allow me to combine these rules in all projects: stained glass or mosaics, painting or architecture.
